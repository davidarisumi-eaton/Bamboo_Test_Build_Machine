//                          - Added state SM2_ENERGY_WRITE_FRAM2 to SPI2_Manager() to handle energy write
//                            requests
//                      - Added code to support reading energy from FRAM
//                          - Added FRAM_ReadEnergy() and FRAM_XferR()

//                        MCP7951 RTC
//                          - Revised RTC_Write() and RTC_Read()
//   0.18   161115  DAH - Deleted THSensorRd() and added ReadTHSensor() as the temperature/humidity sensor
//                        was changed from the SPI bus to the I2C health bus.  Also deleted SM2_RD_THSENSOR
//                        state from SPI2_Manager()
//                      - Modified FRAM_Write() and FRAM_Read() to handle the 256k x 8 FRAM (3-byte
//                        address), which replaced the 32k x 8 FRAM (2-byte address)

//                          - Revised RTC_Read() to check the time for validity, return whether the time is
//                            valid, and to return the time values as hex numbers (not BCD)
//                          - Revised RTC_Write() for the new RTC chip (minor revisions)
//                          - Revised SPI2_Manager() to set the RTC_ERR in SystemFlags if RTC_Read() returns
//                            False 
//                          - Revised SPI2_Manager() to call InternalTime_to_RTC() instead of RTC_Write() so
//                            because the internal time is now written to the RTC instead of the values in
//                            RTC_buf[]
//                      - Added support for energy and demand logging
//                          - Added includes of Flash_def.h and Events_ext.h
//                          - struct EnergyAll was deleted.  The energy tally registers in this structure
//                            were moved into struct EngyDmnd.  EngyDmnd contains all of the variables used
//                            in demand logging, so that the structure can be written directly into FRAM and
//                            Flash.  FRAM_WriteEnergy() and FRAM_ReadEnergy() were revised to use the new
//                            structure
//                          - Added Flash_PageWrite() and Flash_EraseSector()
//                          - Deleted SSt26VF064B Flash Instructions (moved to Iod_def.h since used
//                            globally)
//                          - Add Dmnd_ForceLog and Dmnd_200ms_Per_SubInt_Adj
//                          - Added ProcessTimeAdjustment()
//                      - Corrected bug in State 4 of StoreAFEcalFlash() when setting the write block
//                        protection bits
//   0.23   180504  DAH - Moved Demand subroutines to Demand.c for readability
//                          - Removed Dmnd_ForceLog definition (moved to Demand.c)
//                          - Added Demand_def.h and Demand_ext.h includes
//                      - Revised ProcessTimeAdjustment() to eliminate computing Dmnd_200ms_Per_SubInt_Adj.
//                        The demand sub-intervals are no longer adjusted.  We are now using the real-time
//                        counter to determine the anniversary times
//                      - Removed Dmnd_200ms_Per_SubInt_Adj as it is no longer used
//                      - Corrected bug in InternalTime_to_RTC()
//                      - In SM2_CAL_WRITE_FLASH state of SPI2_Manager(), added FLASH_IN_USE (in
//                        SystemFlags) when writing to the Flash
//   0.24   180517  DAH - Deleted SPI2_Manager() and associated variables and constants.  All of the SPI2
//                        operations can be done immediately in the requesting subroutine, except for Flash
//                        accesses.  These need to be managed, because the Flash may be accessed for demand
//                        read/writes, setpoint read/writes, waveform read/writes, or cal constant
//                        read/writes.  The Flash management is handled in the calling subroutines using
//                        request and access flags (reference FRAM_Flash_def.h).
//                        Note, this SPI2 may be used this way provided it is not used with DAM or
//                        interrupts!  The longest write would be waveforms to Flash.  At 15MHz and 256
//                        bytes (the page size), this takes 136usec.  This is not worth using DMA.
//                          - Added FlashCtrl (flags word for Flash access control)
//                      - Renamed StoreAFEcalFlash() to StoreCalFlash() since it now is used to store AFE,
//                        ADC, and test injection calibration constants
//                      - Revised StoreCalFlash() to check whether the Flash is in use before proceeding and
//                        to handle both metering and test injection calibration constants.
//                      - Moved FRAM_Write(), FRAM_Stat_Write(), EEPOT_Write(), EEPOT_Xfer(),
//                        FRAM_WriteEnergy(), and StoreCalFlash() from the local definition section to the
//                        global definition section as these are now used globally
//                      - Revised FRAM_ReadEnergy() and FRAM_WriteEnergy() to work with the FM25V20 FRAM
//                        (they had been designed for the FM25V05).
//                      - Combined Flash_def.h and FRAM_def.h
//                          - Deleted include of Flash_def.h
//                          - Replaced include of FRAM_def.h with FRAM_Flash_def.h
//                          - Revised StoreAFEcalFlash(), ReadAFECalConstants(), ReadADCHCalConstants(),
//                            ReadADCLCalConstants() with new Flash addresses
//                      - Modified Flash_PageWrite(), Flash_EraseSector(), and StoreCalFlash() to
//                        reinitialize SPI2 in each state that may be entered when the subroutine is
//                        invoked, because SPI2 may now be used in different threads (via the main loop)
//                        when Flash_PageWrite(), Flash_EraseSector(), and StoreCalFlash() are exited
//                      Added support for alarm waveform captures
//                          - Added struct Alarm_WF_Capture
//                          - Revised IO_VarInit() to initialize Alarm_WF_Capture.xxx
//   0.25   180621  DAH - Added support for SPI2 requests to be handled in the 1.5msec ISR (for waveform
//                        writes to Flash)
//                          - Added SPI2_NoFlash_Manager() and struct S2NF.  These handle non-Flash SPI2
//                            access requests.  Modified IO_VarInit() to initialize the SPI_2 variables.
//                          - Added SPI2_Flash_Manager() and struct SPI2Flash.  These handle Flash SPI2
//                            access requests.  Modified IO_VarInit() to initialize the SPI2Flash variables.
//                          - Moved StoreCalFlash() and FRAM_WriteEnergy() from the global definition
//                            section to the local definition section as these are no longer used globally
//                          - Deleted FlashCtrl since it is no longer used
//                      - Fixed error in Get_InternalTime() (10msec counter was not converted correctly)
//                      - Fixed bug in Get_InternalTime() (SysTick->VAL could read as zero after rollover
//                        because the counter had not yet been reloaded with the initial count)
//                      - Added support for the startup time measurement function
//                          - Added ReadStartupScaleConstant()
//                          - Revised StartupTimeCal() to write the startup scaling constant to FRAM
//                      - Added support for Alarm waveform capture events
//                          - Added Flash_WriteWaveform()
//                          - Replaced Flash_EraseSector() with Flash_EraseSectorBlock().  The new routine
//                            is used to erase both sectors (for demand storage) and blocks (for waveform
//                            storage)
//                          - Modified IO_VarInit() to retrieve AlarmWF_Add from FRAM
//                      - Corrected bug in RTC_to_SysTickTime() (hundredths was incorrectly multiplied by
//                        10 before being saved in the 10msec count)
//   0.25   180627  DAH - In StartupTimeCal(), renamed SystemFlags GET_STARTUPTIME to FIRST_PASS
//                      - Added support for energy reads from FRAM
//                          - Added S2NF_ENERGY_READ_FRAM2 state to SPI2_NoFlash_Manager()
//                      - Moved FRAM_ReadEnergy() from the global section to the local section
//                      - Modified ReadAFECalConstants(), ReadADCHCalConstants(), ReadADCLCalConstants() to
//                        only read the Flash if the FRAM constants have a checksum error.  The Flash
//                        constants will be checked in the main loop.  This is done to reduce the execution
//                        time of the initialization code.
//                      - Added support for checking the Flash cal constants
//                          - Added S2F_CHECK_CAL_CONSTS state to SPI2_Flash_Manager()
//   0.26   180829  DAH - NUM_WAVEFORMS changed to NUM_ALARM_WAVEFORMS in IO_VarInit() (Flash memory mapping
//                        was modified)
//   0.27   181001  DAH - Added support for Trip waveform captures
//                          - Added structure Trip_WF_Capture
//                          - Revised IO_VarInit() to initialize Trip_WF_Capture.xxx
//                          - Added Trip waveform writes to S2F_NEXT_STATE[ ]
//                          - Revised S2F_ALARM_WF_WRITE state of SPI2_Flash_Manager() to handle aborting
//                            the alarm waveform capture if a trip capture is requested
//                          - Revised Flash_WriteWaveform() to handle Alarm, Trip, and Strip-Chart waveforms

//                        the corresponding request flag is clear
//                      - Changed the priority of the Flash requests for waveforms so that erase operations
//                        are higher than write operations.  The blocks must be erased before a new waveform
//                        is written, so erases should be a higher priority.
//                          - S2F_NEXT_STATE[ ] revised
//                      - Corrected bug in S2F_ALARM_WF_BLKERASE1 state of SPI2_Flash_Manager().
//                        S2F_ALARM_WF_WR was incorrectly set when the erase was completed.  This caused an
//                        additional unnecessary block erase to occur
//                      - Corrected bug in case 2 of Flash_WriteWaveform() when computing the FRAM address
//                        for the waveform header
//                      - Added support for Strip-Chart waveform captures

//                          - Revised IO_VarInit() to initialize Chart_WF_Capture.xxx
//                          - Added Strip-Chart waveform writes to S2F_NEXT_STATE[ ]

//                          - Added code to ReadSwitches() to set TEST_INJ_INIT_OFF flag in  TestInj.Flags
//                            if test injection is running and the Reset LEDs pushbutton is pressed
//   0.32   190726  DAH - Added code to write min and max demands into FRAM
//                          - Added FRAM_WriteMinMax()

//                            to handle requests to write min and max demands into FRAM
//   0.35   191118  DAH - Size of ADCcalLow.gain[], ADCcalLow.offset[], ADCcalHigh.gain[], and
//                        ADCcalHigh.offset[] reduced from 10 to 8
//                          - Revised ReadADCHCalConstants() and ReadADCLCalConstants() accordingly
//                      - Added gain and offset constants for Rogowski Igsrc into struct AFEcal.  Added gain
//                        and offset constants for CT In into struct AFEcal
//                          - Revised ReadAFECalConstants() accordingly
//                      - Added gain and offset constants for CT In into struct ADCcalHigh and struct

//   0.37   200604  DAH - Added support for reading events (Read Delayed Requests) for display proc comms
//                          - Added SPI2_buf[]
//                          - Added S2NF_DP_REQUEST state to SPI2_NoFlash_Manager()
//                      - Began code to support reading waveforms for display processor communications
//                          - Added S2F_DP_READ_WF to S2F_NEXT_STATE[ ]
//                        This code may end up getting deleted
//                      - Moved events-related initialization out of IO_VarInit() (moved into
//                        Event_VarInit())
//                      - Revised Flash waveform storage algorithm to use an index to compute the Flash and
//                        FRAM addresses instead of the actual Flash address.  This is easier to manipulate,
//                        and provides commonality between the Flash and FRAM storage.
//                          - Added struct EV_ADD EV_Add to struct FLASH_INT_REQ
//                          - Revised Flash_WriteWaveform() to replace the Flash address with

//                            waveforms when they are erased (not necessary), and added code to compute the
//                            Flash address from the index
//                          - In Flash_WriteWaveform(), for struct FLASH_INT_REQ, StartIndex was renamed
//                            SampleStartIndex so it is not confused with the Event storage index
//                      - Revised Flash waveform storage to only store the required header bytes in
//                        struct FLASH_INT_REQ instead of the entire structure.  The structure was modified
//                        to ensure there are no padding bytes.  This was done to reduce the read and write
//                        times for the header info, and to reduce the required FRAM storage space.
//                          - Revised Flash_WriteWaveform() and SPI2_NoFlash_Manager() (case S2NF_TP_READ)
//                            accordingly
//                      - The MasterEID storage in FRAM was altered to include a complement and second copy
//                          - Revised ProcessTimeAdjustment() and SPI2_NoFlash_Manager() (case

//                      - The Startup Time Scale Constant storage in FRAM was altered.  The second copy was
//                        moved
//                          - Revised SPI2_NoFlash_Manager() (case S2NF_WRITE_STARTUP) and
//                            ReadStartupScaleConstant() accordingly
//                      - The waveform capture index and number of captures storage in FRAM was altered to
//                        include a complement and second copy

//                          - Replaced Energy_Log_Add with EV_Dmnd.NextDmndAdd and EV_Dmnd.Num_Entries
//                          - Revised SPI2_Flash_Manager() to increment EV_Dmnd.Num_Entries when an entry is
//                            made and to reduce it when a sector is erased after it has rolled over
//                      - In S2F_TP_READ state of SPI2_Flash_Manager(), modified Flash address rollover
//                        check from "> ENERGY_SECTOR_END" to ">= ENERGY_SECTOR_END" because events
//                        are not stored in the ENERGY_SECTOR_END sector.  ENERGY_SECTOR_END marks the end
//                        of events storage
//   0.38   200708  DAH - Added support for writing setpoints (test purpose only) to Flash
//                          - Added test_setpoints[] to store the values written by the Display Processor

//                            SPI2_Flash_Manager().  These states erase the setpoints sector, then write an
//                            8-byte test code into the sector
//   0.41   201028  DAH - Added test code to retrieve setpoints for proc-proc comms
//                          - SPI2_NoFlash_Manager() (case S2NF_DP_REQUEST) and IO_VarInit() revised
//                          - Test variables MB_xx added
//   0.42   201202  DAH - Added Check_IntRTC(), IntRTC_Write(), and IntRTC_Read()to support the internal RTC
//                      - Revised RTC_to_SysTickTime() to work with the internal RTC and for more general
//                        use
//                      - In SPI2_NoFlash_Manager() deleted S2NF_RTC_READ and S2NF_RTC_WRITE states as the
//                        external RTC is no longer used
//                      - Deleted RTC_Read() and RTC_Write() as they are no longer used

//                      - Added IntRTC_Update(), RTC_State, and RTC_ShiftVal to adjust the
//                        RTC to internal time
//                      - Deleted InternalTime_to_RTC() as it has basically been replaced by calling
//                        InternalTimeRead() and IntRTC_Write() in IntRTC_Update()
//                      - RTC_buf[] size reduced from 18 to 12
//                      - Deleted RTC and Internal Time subroutines and associated variables (moved to
//                        RealTime.c).  Added include of RealTime_def.h
//   0.45   210504  DAH - Added S2F_INJ_READ_FLASH state to SPI2_Flash_Manager() to read the test injection
//                        constants
//   0.46   210521  DAH - Corrected bug in Flash_WriteWaveform().  The address in WF_Struct->FlashAdd needed
//                        to be shifted left 4 bits, so that it is in the format SSSP (sector address is in
//                        b15..b4, page address is in b3..0)
//                      - Corrected bug in SPI2_NoFlash_Manager().  In state S2NF_TP_READ, corrected the
//                        output buffer
//                      - Corrected bug in SPI2_Flash_Manager().  For Trip, Alarm, and Strip-Chart waveform
//                        block erases, the address in xxx.FlashAdd must be shifted left 4 bits, so that it
//                        is in the format SSSP (sector address is in b15..b4, page address is in b3..0)
//                      - Added code to Flash_WriteWaveform() to save the EID and increment it.  The code is
//                        temporary for the arc flash demo unit.  It should be reviewed and probably moved.
//                      - In state S2F_TP_READ in SPI2_Flash_Manager(), added code to support reading both
//                        voltages and currents.  Previous code only supported reading currents.

//                      - Revised StartupTimeCal() to replace code that set S2NF_WR_STARTUP with calls to
//                        FRAM_Write()
//                      - In Flash_WriteWaveform(), deleted the code that captured the EID and waveform
//                        header, and wrote the index and number of samples to FRAM.  This has all been
//                        moved to EventManager()
//                      - In ReadInjCalConstants(), deleted the code that reads the test injection cal
//                        constants from FRAM.  This has been moved to TP_Top()
//                      - Deleted test injection default cal constants (moved to Test.c)
//                      - In SPI2_Flash_Manager(), state S2F_INJ_WRITE_FLASH, deleted the code that writes
//                        the test injection cal constants to FRAM.  This has been moved to
//                        TP_TestInjOffsetCal() and TP_TestInjGainCal()
//                      - Revised StoreCalFlash(), Flash_PageWrite(), Flash_WriteWaveform(),
//                        Flash_EraseSectorBlock(), and Flash_Read() to use SPI1 instead of SPI2
//   0.60   220928  DAH - Revised FRAM_Read() to eliminate device parameter as it is dedicated to the

//   0.68   230124  DB  - ExtCap_FRAM_Read and ExtCap_FRAM_Write added. These handle SPI2 writes/reads out
//                        in/from BB FRAM
//   0.69   230220  DAH - Strip chart waveform captures has been deleted and replaced with the extended

//   133    231219  DAH - Eliminated code in ReadTHSensor() that sets temperature and humidity to large
//                        values if an error occurs.  This was causing temperature trips to occur.  The
//                        values are not updated if an error occurs.
//                      - Added code to initialize THSensor.xx so we don't generate a false trip
//   135    231221  DAH - Revised Flash_WriteWaveform() to fill waveform precycles with zero if they have
//                        not been written yet
//   141    20115   BP  - Added code to flash the Status LED red for an Energy fault
//   142    240119  DAH - Added code to support factory commands for changing calibration constants
//                          - Added ReadAFECalConstants1(), ReadADCHCalConstants1(), and
//                            ReadADCLCalConstants1()
//                          - Added S1F_READ_AFE_CALCONST1, S1F_READ_ADCH_CALCONST1, and
//                            S1F_READ_ADCL_CALCONST1 states to SPI1_Flash_Manager()
//                      - Revised Flash_Read_ID() to store value in union Flash_ID
//                      - Revised ProcessTimeAdjustment() to set SKIP_LOOPTIME_MEAS flag
//   144    240123  DAH - In ReadAFECalConstants1(), corrected bug checking the checksum when FRAM was read

//
//  FUNCTION:           Write Waveform to Flash
//                      
//  MECHANICS:          This subroutine writes a trip or alarm waveform into Flash.  The waveform is written
//                      a page at a time.  The subroutine works as follows:
//                          Issue Write Enable (WREN) instruction
//                              - Allows a write command to have affect
//                          Issue Page Program (PP) command
//                              - This programs the part with the new data
//                              - Write disable is automatically activated when this instruction is finished
//                          Issue Read Status Register instruction
//                              - Wait until the page program has been completed.  This should be on the
//                                call, since the interrupt is set to occur every 1.5msec
//                      Notes:
//                          1) It is assumed that the data is in an unprotected section of Flash.  The write
//                             protection unlock command is NOT issued.
//                          2) The length, num_words, is in words, so up to 128 words may be written.

//                          Entry state:
//                            LED data signals all low (off)
//                            LED strobe signal is configured as an input so when reset button is pushed,
//                              no current is drawn from the battery
//                            LED strobe signal output data register (ODR) is set high so signal will be
//                              high when strobe is configured to be an output
//                          (1) Turn on the LED signal according to COT_AUX.COT_Code.  Only one LED will be
//                              turned on.  If the code is invalid, all of the LEDs will be turned off
//                          (2) Turn on the strobe signal - this reconfigures the port line from an input to
//                              a push-pull output, and drives the port line high
//                          (3) Delay about 4usec to ensure the signal at the latch goes high, as there is
//                              an RC filter on the signal
//                          (4) Lower the strobe signal
//                          (5) Delay about 4usec to ensure the signal at the latch goes low, as there is an
//                              RC filter on the signal.  We want to make sure the signal is low before
//                              changing the inputs to the latch, in case the strobe signal has noise on it
//                              (don't want a false state to be written due to noise)
//                          (6) Switch the strobe signal back to an input
//                          (7) Set the strobe ODR register to high so the output will be high when the
//                              strobe port is reconfigured as an output
//                          (8) Lower all of the LED control lines so that if the reset pushbutton is
//                              pushed, the LEDs will be cleared
